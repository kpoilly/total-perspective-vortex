# Total Perspective Vortex

This project, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum, explores the creation of a simple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).

The objective is to use Machine Learning techniques to analyze Electroencephalographic (EEG) data and predict a subject's intention or action (movement A or B) based on their brain activity.

The project involves processing EEG signals, applying dimensionality reduction algorithms (part of which will be implemented from scratch), building a classification pipeline, and simulating near real-time prediction.


## Technologies Used

- Python

- MNE (for EEG data processing)

- Scikit-learn (for the ML pipeline and classification)

- NumPy & SciPy (for numerical computations, including the dimensionality reduction algorithm implementation)


## Dataset

The data used comes from the PhysioNet database.
